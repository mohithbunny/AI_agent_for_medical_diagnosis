### Final Diagnosis:

After reviewing the medical reports from the Cardiologist, Psychologist, and Pulmonologist, our multidisciplinary team has identified the following 3 possible health issues of the patient:

* **Anxiety Disorder with Panic Attacks**: The patient's symptoms of chest pain, heart palpitations, and shortness of breath are consistent with panic attacks, and their history of anxiety disorder suggests that this may be a contributing factor to their symptoms. (Reason: Consistency of symptoms with anxiety disorder, history of anxiety diagnosis, and potential exacerbation of anxiety symptoms.)
* **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) with Respiratory Complications**: The patient's symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath may be related to GERD, which can cause respiratory symptoms such as coughing or wheezing. (Reason: GERD as a possible cause of chest pain and shortness of breath, and potential respiratory complications.)
* **Undiagnosed Cardiac Condition or Arrhythmia**: Despite normal ECG, blood tests, and echocardiogram, there may be an underlying cardiac condition or arrhythmia that is not yet apparent, such as a subtle arrhythmia or structural abnormality. (Reason: Possibility of an underlying cardiac condition or arrhythmia not yet diagnosed, and need for further evaluation with stress test, event monitor, and cardiac MRI.)
