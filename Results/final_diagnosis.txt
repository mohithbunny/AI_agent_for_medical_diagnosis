### Final Diagnosis:

After reviewing the medical reports from the Cardiologist, Psychologist, and Pulmonologist, our multidisciplinary team has identified the following 3 possible health issues of the patient:

* **Anxiety Disorder with Panic Attacks**: The patient's symptoms of chest pain, heart palpitations, and shortness of breath, along with their history of anxiety diagnosis and fear of having a heart attack, suggest a possible exacerbation of anxiety symptoms. The Cardiologist, Psychologist, and Pulmonologist all identify anxiety as a potential contributor to the patient's symptoms.

* **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: The Cardiologist and Pulmonologist both suggest that GERD may be contributing to the patient's symptoms, particularly chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient's high-stress job and irregular exercise habits may be exacerbating GERD symptoms.

* **Undiagnosed Cardiac or Respiratory Condition**: Despite normal test results, the Cardiologist and Pulmonologist both suggest that there may be an underlying cardiac or respiratory condition that is not yet apparent. The patient's symptoms and test results do not fully explain their condition, and further evaluation is necessary to rule out any potential underlying conditions.
